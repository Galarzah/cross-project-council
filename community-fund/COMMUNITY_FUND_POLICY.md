# Cross Project Council Community Fund

## About The Community Fund

The OpenJS Foundationâ€™s community fund supports travel and attendance at events and activities directly related to OpenJS projects, technologies, or goals. We support travel for individuals who are:

* Collaborators
* Standards body participants
* Speakers

The fund can cover the costs, in whole or in part, of a participant's hotel, airfare, and some event registrations.
Applicants should explore employer-sponsored funding options as their first source of financial support.
Additionally, 25% of the community fund is allocated specifically to support diverse participants.
Funding decisions are determined by a combination of need and potential impact.

## Community Fund Rules

Valid travel expenses are:

* Coach airfare tickets
* Accommodations (Dates of the event plus one night prior are eligible for reimbursement)
* Ground transportation to/from the airport

NOTE: Funds may not be used for miscellaneous travel expenses including food, visa costs, non-airport transportation, baggage fees, etc. Generally, registration can be reimbursed if the attendee is speaking on behalf of OpenJS, the CPC or OpenJS-hosted projects. Funding is not transferable to another person, or any other event. 

Travel fund assistance can only be received once per year.
