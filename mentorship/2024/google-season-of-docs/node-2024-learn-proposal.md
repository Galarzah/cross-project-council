# Google Season Of Docs 2024 Proposal

The following proposal is intended to be submitted to the 2024 Google Season of Docs program. It follows Google's suggested [template](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/org-proposal-template).

## Proposal Title 

Node.js Learn, Creating World-class Learning material for Node.js - The OpenJS Foundation

## About Your Organization

### About The OpenJS Foundation

The OpenJS Foundation is the home of a wide range of JavaScript projects including Appium, Electron, jQuery, Node.js, webpack, and many more. In 2019, the Node.js Foundation and JS Foundation merged to form the OpenJS Foundation. The merger was the result of extensive reflection and collaboration by both communities and their governing bodies. It reflected a shared desire to simplify and streamline the process for hosting, sustaining and providing financial support to important projects in the JavaScript ecosystem.

### About Node.js
Node.js is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools and scripts. In 2023, Node.js had over 2 billion downloads.

## About The Project

### The Project's Problem

The Node.js runtime is the world's most popular and widely adopted JavaScript runtime. Node.js enables JavaScript Developers to create the next big thing. Node.js is a fundmanetal cornterstone of the Web.

Yet, as popular as Node.js might be, Node.js as a project needs fundamental learning material that allows people to kickstart and dive deep into the powerhouse of Node.js. Hundreds of content creators support the Node.js community with courses and learning material. Still, the Node.js project itself lacks fundamental learning material that allows newcomers and existing users of Node.js to get quickly started with the basics to the next big thing that Node.js provides.

### The Project's Scope

This project aims to update the existing Learn material available on the Node.js website and create new learning material Some of the expected tasks of this project include:

* Reorganising and re-categorising the existing content
* Rephrasing and improving existing content
* Updating existing Learn outdated material
* Introducing new learning material that is relevant to the user base of Node.js

During this mentorship, the mentee can expect to be guided through the basics and fundamentals of Node.js to the gritty nitty and the shiny new features of Node.js.

### Measuring Success

The success of this project is measured on at least 3 pillars for Node.js's Learn material.

- That we successfully audited the existing learning material/content
  - Not all learn pages might require extensive updates, so the success criteria are personal and depend on outcomes
    throughout the rundown of this mentorship.
- That new learning material was created based on the project's needs. It is up to the mentee to come up with new ideas
  and it is expected that the mentor will provide feedback and guidance regarding what needs to be done.
- That both the mentor and the mentee are happy with the resulting outcome of this mentorship.

Since these requirements are dynamic, the project's actual success indicator is determined by both parties
agreement (mentor and mentee) that all the required work was accomplished.

For the mentorship itself and the resulting outcomes, we can expect that the success of the project is measured by:

- Improved documentation completeness, covering essential aspects of Node.js.
- Enhanced clarity, ensuring that developers can easily understand the concepts and usage of Node.js.
- Positive feedback and reduced queries related to Node.js usage on community forums and GitHub issues.
