# OpenJS Foundation / Google Season of Docs 2024

The [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org) is applying for the [2024 Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs).

OpenJS hosts 35 critical JavaScript projects including Node.js, Electron, jQuery, webpack, Appium and Jest. 
Our mission is to support the healthy growth of JavaScript and web technologies by providing a neutral organization to host and sustain projects, as well as collaboratively fund activities that benefit the ecosystem as a whole.

We are looking for a few skilled technical writers who can help with a number of our projects. We have a large, welcoming community and would like to help grow new participants.

If you have any questions, please reach out on the [OpenJS Foundation Slack](https://slack.openjsf.org).

Here is a list of our proposals, as well as some resources to help you learn about the OpenJS Foundation.
